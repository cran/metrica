\usage{
gmean(
  data = NULL,
  obs,
  pred,
  pos_level = 2,
  atom = FALSE,
  tidy = FALSE,
  na.rm = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(Optional) argument to call an existing data frame containing the data.}

\item{obs}{Vector with observed values (character | factor).}

\item{pred}{Vector with predicted values (character | factor).}

\item{pos_level}{Integer, for binary cases, indicating the order (1|2) of the level
corresponding to the positive. Generally, the positive level is the second (2)
since following an alpha-numeric order, the most common pairs are
\code{(Negative | Positive)}, \code{(0 | 1)}, \code{(FALSE | TRUE)}. Default : 2.}

\item{atom}{Logical operator (TRUE/FALSE) to decide if the estimate is made for
each class (atom = TRUE) or at a global level (atom = FALSE); Default : FALSE.
When dataset is "binomial" atom does not apply.}

\item{tidy}{Logical operator (TRUE/FALSE) to decide the type of return. TRUE
returns a data.frame, FALSE returns a list; Default : FALSE.}

\item{na.rm}{Logic argument to remove rows with missing values
(NA). Default is na.rm = TRUE.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{numeric} within a \code{list} (if tidy = FALSE) or within a
\verb{data frame} (if tidy = TRUE).
}
\description{
It estimates the Geometric Mean score for a nominal/categorical
predicted-observed dataset.
}
\details{
The gmean is a metric especially useful for imbalanced classes because it
measures the balance between the classification performance on both major (over-represented)
as well as on minor (under-represented) classes. As stated above, it is particularly
useful when the number of observations belonging to each class is uneven.

The gmean score is equivalent to the square-root of the product of specificity
and recall (a.k.a. sensitivity).

\eqn{gmean = \sqrt{recall * specificity} }

It is bounded between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the better the classification performance,
while zero represents the worst.

\donttest{
set.seed(123)
# Two-class
binomial_case <- data.frame(labels = sample(c("True","False"), 100, replace = TRUE), 
predictions = sample(c("True","False"), 100, replace = TRUE))
# Get gmean estimate for two-class case
