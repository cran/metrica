\title{Mean Squared Error (MSE)}
\usage{
MSE(data = NULL, obs, pred, tidy = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(Optional) argument to call an existing data frame containing the data.}

\item{obs}{Vector with observed values (numeric).}

\item{pred}{Vector with predicted values (numeric).}

\item{tidy}{Logical operator (TRUE/FALSE) to decide the type of return. TRUE
returns a data.frame, FALSE returns a list; Default : FALSE.}

\item{na.rm}{Logic argument to remove rows with missing values
(NA). Default is na.rm = TRUE.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{numeric} within a \code{list} (if tidy = FALSE) or within a
\verb{data frame} (if tidy = TRUE).
}
\description{
It estimates the MSE for a continuous predicted-observed dataset.
}
\details{
The MSE, also known as MSD, measures general agreement, as includes both
variance (lack of precision) and bias (lack of accuracy). The MSE of predictions
could be decomposed following a variety of approaches (e.g. Willmott et al. 1981; Correndo et al. 2021).
Its calculation is simple, the sum of squared differences between predictions and observations
divided by the sample size (n). The greater the value the worse the predicted performance.
Unfortunately, the units of MSE do not have a direct interpretation. For a more direct interpretation,
the square root of MSE (RMSE) has the same units as the variable of interest.
